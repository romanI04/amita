# üöÄ amita.ai Sprint Implementation Tasks

## Overview
Critical improvements focused on **trust, conversion, and first-run experience** based on PM analysis.

### Key Problems Identified

- ‚ùå Trust indicators (95% accuracy, 10k+ writers) are hardcoded lies
- ‚ùå No email verification resend flow despite error messages
- ‚ùå Voice profile creation blocks users unnecessarily
- ‚ùå No enforcement of free tier limits
- ‚ùå Poor mobile experience (375px overflow, small touch targets)

## Database Migrations Needed

```sql
-- Add subscription fields to profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN subscription_status text DEFAULT 'free';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN subscription_tier text DEFAULT 'free';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN trial_ends_at timestamp;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id text;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_subscription_id text;

-- Create subscriptions history table
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  stripe_subscription_id text,
  status text,
  tier text,
  amount integer,
  currency text,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);

-- Add demo tracking
CREATE TABLE demo_usage (
  ip_address text PRIMARY KEY,
  usage_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  last_used timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

## Environment Variables Needed

```bash
# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Redis (optional for caching)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Email (for magic links)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
```

## Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Stripe delays | Start with trial-only, add payment later |
| xAI rate limits | Cache demo texts, limit to 3/day/IP |
| Free tier abuse | Require email verification, track IPs |
| Mobile bugs | Progressive enhancement, test on real devices |
| Performance issues | Start with basic caching, optimize later |

---

## Notes

- **Priority Order**: Trust (demo reality) ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí Conversion ‚Üí Polish
- **Quick Wins**: Real demo, trust indicators, request IDs can ship Day 1
- **Blockers**: Need Stripe account, Redis setup for caching
- **Testing**: Each task needs both unit and integration tests
- **Analytics**: Every user action needs telemetry events
